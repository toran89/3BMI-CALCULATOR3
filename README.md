# 3BMI-CALCULATOR3
good learning
a lot to share but forgetin those points, I got to know that innerHTML n all those other properties convert the value you provide into strings so have to convert again into Number, a very long process like first assign then get then convert then compare bla bla. While converting i always use number but this time got to know about parseFloat. cool feature but dont work with "abc124" i thought there will be another property like startParseFloat haha, but i was wrong good thing is like, parseFloat convert "3241fhd" this kinda value easily but cant that first thing.
